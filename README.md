RESULTS

After clicking the "Breed" button the app will simulate two plants breeding and producing 100 offspring.
The results you see are based on percentages of 100 in order to keep the results easily read and understood.

X-"Trait"

If a trait comes back as X-"Trait" that means that the genes have been selected in a way that the trait is codominant
where neither trait is clearly dominant or recessive, meaning that the result could or should be any percent mix of the 
two traits. example, DD RED and DD White = PINK
Green DD + PURPLE DD = X-COLOR
X-Color could be anything between green and purple.

PURPLE

The Purple button is a stand in for whatever color your plant happens to be if it isnt the typical Green/Yellow Cannabis flower color.
